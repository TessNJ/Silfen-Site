          <h1>Sustainability</h1>
          <p>
            Sustainability is a fuzzy word. At SILFEN it means putting action
            behind the words, considering all stakeholders and always aiming a
            little bit higher when creating another collection. As a young,
            global fashion brand, it is our duty to take care of the planet, not
            only for own sake, but for all future generations to come. Since day
            one, we have launched various initiatives to keep our carbon
            footprint to an absolute minimum as well as making conscious
            decisions concerning the social impact on the communities in the
            countries, in which we operate.

          <h2>ON THE WAY TO BETTER PRODUCTION</h2>
          <p>
            As of 2020 we presented the brand under a new name,” SILFEN”. We
            believe that this small change further represents a new and greener
            future for SILFEN. As a company with great manufacturing activities,
            we know that we have a responsibility. Our focus is to make as green
            a production as possible, and we will continue to launch new
            initiatives to lower our carbon footprint even further. Our goal is
            to deliver high quality products in better materials. We started
            implementing more conscious initiatives within the company, and we
            hope that this will inspire you - our customers and consumers, as we
            are all in this together!

            <h3>Water</h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            The fashion industry is one of the most polluting industries
            worldwide, and one of the biggest issues is the use and
            contamination of drinking water. We try to minimize the water
            consumption in our production in an effort to decrease its negative
            impact on the environment and to ensure local access to clean water.
          </p>
          <p>
            All cotton used for production of SILFEN bags is either made from
            eco-friendly or organic cotton. This means that there is much less
            consumption of water throughout production and treatment of our
            cotton, than conventional cotton products.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2020 we introduced a new collection of bags made from a new
            material; rPET or Recycled Polyethylene Terephthalate. This recycled
            material is primarily made from plastic waste collected from the
            oceans, or from recycled plastic bottles gathered from all over the
            world.

            <h3>Shipping</h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            We are aware of the major impact that the shipping industry have on
            our planet. Because of this, we strive to choose
            environmental-friendly shipping options when applicable. We are in
            close contact with other brands in our aim to minimize shipping as
            much as possible - by joining forces.
          </p>
          <p>
            We strive to ship as much as possible in bulk - mostly by sea or
            train. These are the most environmentally friendly modes of
            shipping, reducing polluting emissions.

            At Team Silfen, we believe that we have many, wide-spanning
            obligations. It is not only the environment, we must care for, but
            also the people who build our products from scratch. We believe that
            it is our job to amplify a healthy and socially responsible conduct
            within our organization, including all our suppliers. We ensure the
            ethical development of future generations by guaranteeing that our
            suppliers do not support or make use of child labor. We encourage
            our factories to ensure that all families have the possibility to
            put their children in school.
          </p>
          <p>
            Team Silfen provides insurance to all our hard-working employees as
            well as their family. Our factories also grant pensions to all
            employees, providing them with financial stability after retirement.
          </p>
          <p>
            We support the different religions of employees and protect their
            right to engage with rituals, prayers etc. at any time. We condemn
            discrimination, and make sure that the employees are protected from
            prejudice and injustice at the workplace.
          </p>
          <p>
            We visit our manufacturers regularly to ensure that they follow the
            issued principles regarding working conditions, quality, pollution
            etc. This allows us to promise our customers that a SILFEN bag is
            always crafted in a responsible manner.

              In 2020 we are expecting to launch a new collection manufactured
              in rPET, recycled polyethylene terephthalate. The material is well
              known as it is made from water bottles across the world - bottles
              that often end up discarded in oceans or nature. This recycled
              material is primarily made from plastic waste collected from the
              oceans, or from recycled plastic bottles gathered from all over
              the world. With this new collection, we aim to emphasize the
              impact of pollution irresponsible wasting. We wish to pass this
              awareness to our customers, and to encourage them to help clean
              our oceans!

            <h4>Leather</h4>
            <p>
              All leather goods are made from sustainable high-quality calf
              leather and is a bi product of the food industry, meaning that
              every part of the animal is utilized in various industries. We
              love colors and new trends, but we incorporate consciousness and
              quality in our design processes to retain timelessness in all
              products. All our components, zippers, thread, reinforcement, glue
              etc., are made from high-quality raw materials. We encourage our
              customers to take good care of their bag, prolonging the life of
              the product. By caring for your bag, you will be able to create
              more experiences with it - an important factor in creating a more
              sustainable, mindful business.

            <h4>Vegan</h4>
            <p>
              In 2019, we presented our first vegan option in a collection, and
              we have continued to this since then. We make sure that all
              non-leather material - e.g. our nylon, lacquer - are all 100%
              vegan, promising that these products do not contain any parts from
              animals. Every nylon product is made from eco-friendly material,
              meaning that the journey from raw material to SILFEN bag impacts
              the environment as little as possible.

            <h4>Cotton</h4>
            <p>
              Some of the SILFEN bags is made from Cotton - a fabric commonly
              known as polluting. At SILFEN, our cotton is either made from
              eco-friendly or organic cotton. Both materials require far less
              water consumption than conventional cotton products.
